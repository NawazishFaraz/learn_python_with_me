#Primarily these are the following data types in Python: 
#1. Integers 
#2. Floating point numbers 
#3. Strings 
#4. Booleans  
#5. None 
#Python is a fantastic language that automatically identifies the type of data for us.

a= 71         
# identifies a as class <int> 

b=88.44       
# identifies b as class <float> 

name= "harry" # identifies name as class <str>
